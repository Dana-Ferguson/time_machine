///  Provides a [DateTimeZone] wrapper class that implements a simple cache to
///  speed up the lookup of transitions.
///
/// The cache supports mulTiple caching strategies which are implemented in nested subclasses of
/// this one. Until we have a better sense of what the usage behavior is, we cannot tune the
/// cache. It is possible that we may support multiple strategies selectable at runtime so the
/// user can tune the performance based on their knowledge of how they are using the system.
///
/// In fact, only one cache type is currently implemented: an MRU cache existed before
/// the GetZoneIntervalPair call was created in DateTimeZone, but as it wasn't being used, it
/// was more effort than it was worth to update. The mechanism is still available for future
/// expansion though.
